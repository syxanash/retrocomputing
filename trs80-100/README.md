## Experiments

Here you can find a Game of Life algorithms I wrote for TRS-80 model 100.
The file with `*T.bas` are transpiled BASIC programs. The simplified ones are those without the `T` at the end of the file name and are slighly easier to read without line numbers.

The program `GOL.bas` runs Game of Life with a spinning loader at the corner of the screen.

The program `GOLLOADER.bas` does the same thing but it also shows a loading bar at the bottom of the screen.

Program `MATRIXGOL.bas` is another implementation of Game of Life using a multidimensional array and two nested FOR loops to go through the iterations.

The transpiler written in Ruby is called `baspiler.rb` (BAsic tranSPILER ðŸ‘€). To use it simply run it like this:

```
ruby baspiler.rb PROGRAM.BAS
```

It will output a new file called: `PROGRAMT.BAS`.

`Neighbours.java` instead is the algorithm I sketched before starting to write the actual code in BASIC.
